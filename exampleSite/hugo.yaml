    content: |-
      Hello, my name is Wes. I grew up on a horse farm surrounded by all kinds of animals. Naturally, I have a deep love for animals and sincerely enjoy helping out. I have been dog-walking and pet sitting in Los Angeles since 2024, as well as volunteering at a local shelter since 2023. I moved to Los Angeles to write and sing songs, but discovered that I missed the farm life surrounded by animals more than I could have ever anticipated.
      
      I am very good with animals and this led me to begin walking and sitting for local friends and families that I have come to know during my time in LA. I am always looking to meet new people and animals, so I decided to build this website to make it easier for people to reach me and learn more about me.
      
      Cheers, Wes
